# Design-of-An-Optoelectronic-Integrated-Circuit
In this project, we have simulated an optoelectronic integrated circuit. The idea is to
use a solar cell to drive a LASER, the output of which will be an optical signal of
single frequency. This output is fed to a photodetector designed to detect that
particular wavelength. Among notable challenges were the modelling of the gain vs
wavelength curve for different injections from literature, and choosing the width of
the photodetector such that a reasonable photocurrent is generated. As a part of
future work, we can design the circuit to include a modulator that will modulate the
output of laser to a different frequency. We can also include an LED that will turn
ON to indicate that every block is working fine.
